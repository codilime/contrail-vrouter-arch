SxLibIssueOidRequest

Routine Description:

    Utility routine that forms and sends an NDIS_OID_REQUEST to the
    miniport, waits for it to complete, and returns status
    to the caller.

    NOTE: this assumes that the calling routine ensures validity
    of the filter handle until this returns.
    
    This function can only be called at PASSIVE_LEVEL.

Arguments:

    Switch - pointer to our switch object.

    RequestType - NdisRequest[Set|Query|method]Information.

    Oid - the object being set/queried.

    InformationBuffer - data for the request.

    InformationBufferLength - length of the above.

    OutputBufferLength - valid only for method request.

    MethodId - valid only for method request.
    
    Timeout - The timeout in seconds for the OID. 

    BytesNeeded - place to return bytes read/written.

Return Value:

    NDIS_STATUS_***

Routine Description:
    This function is called to get the current array

    Switch - the Switch context
    
    NicArray - the returned NIC array
    
Return Value:

    NDIS_STATUS_*** - otherwise
